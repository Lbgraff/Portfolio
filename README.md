# Portfolio
I created a repository in Github named "Portfolio", which I cloned onto my local device.

I created a web page where I can continue to add links to my projects as I complete them during Boot Camp.

This web page includes a title, my picture, a professional and a personal bio, as well as links to placeholder pictures representing the future projects I will create.

I added links to sections and items from the ul/li nav bars, which route the user to these respective locations within the page.

I linked my HTML to my CSS in order to complete styling and responsivity requirements.

I included links to my contact info.
