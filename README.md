# Portfolio
I created a repository in Github named "Portfolio", which I cloned onto my local device.

I created a web page where I can continue to add links to my projects as I complete them during Boot Camp.

This web page includes a title, my picture, a professional and a personal bio, as well as links to a project I created and placeholder pictures representing the future projects I will create.

I added links to sections and items from the ul/li nav bars, which route the user to these respective locations within the page.

Clicking the picture for my first project will route the user to my published website for Horiseon, the module 1 challenge.

I linked my HTML to my CSS in order to complete styling and responsivity requirements.

I included links to my contact info.
